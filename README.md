# Numpy 
NumPy stands for Numerical Python. It is an Open Source Python library used for working with arrays. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, Fourier transform, and matrices.

Advantages of Numpy over Python List:

NumPy provides an array object (ndarray) that is up to 70x faster than traditional Python lists. NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.This behavior is called locality of reference.This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists.

# Installation:
! pip install numpy

# Usage:
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
